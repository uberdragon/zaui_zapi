# zaui_zapi
A gem to provide the communication layer with the Zaui.com zAPI and your application.

### Installation
Add this to your project's Gemfile
```gem 'zaui_zapi'```


#### Notes
This gem is currently under heavy development so watch this page regularly for new releases as they become available.  There is plenty of work to do to get this gem usable for the entire zAPI interface, I encourge you to contribute.
